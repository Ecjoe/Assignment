I am excited about this Quant Analyst role at Quantinsti. It aligns well with my expertise in data science and algo trading. For the past 2 years, I have been at MSCI where I was involved in building factor models for MSCI factor products. Apart from that, I contributed to the development of different Python packages that help the researcher build equity and climate indexes, which are used by hedge funds and other prop trading desks all around the world. 

I had to take a break for a year due to medical reasons, but now I am fully fit and eager to restart my career with the same passion and dedication.

I understand what the role involves;
1. Deep interest in quant research and trading
2. Blend your research with content development for different courses like epat, etc.
3. leverage my machine learning expertise to create unique and stable strategies.
4. ENhance the quality of blogs and articles.

Given my experience in financial data analysis and statistical modeling, I am confident that I can contribute to Quantinsti's vision while further deepening my expertise in this domain.
